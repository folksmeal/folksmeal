   Answer: Yes. Our logistics network is optimized for NCR traffic patterns. We use advanced route planning to ensure meals arrive on time, every time.

   Answer: Absolutely. Our app allows employees to set preferences (Veg, Non-Veg, Jain, Keto, etc.), and our menus rotate daily to prevent boredom.

4. What is the minimum order size?
   Answer: We typically work with companies having 50+ employees to ensure the best value and service levels.
